This is how to run the hardware simulator:
```bash
~/Documents/Projects/nand2tetris/tools/HardwareSimulator.sh ../projects/The-Elements-of-Computing-Systems/1/Not.tst
End of script - Comparison ended successfully
```
Chapter 11 is incomplete (due to spaghetti code and deadline pressures). Should've kept in mind that functions are "class\_name.function\_name", shouldn't have tried to change the structure of my already correct code parsing, should've made more and better helper functions, should've put code into modules of different files (chapter 11 is massive), should've understood the difference between static functions and methods, should've planned better.

Chapter 12 is also incomplete for String, Memory, Screen, Output.
